# emnist-character-classifier
This repository contains a Python machine learning project for classifying handwritten characters using the Extended MNIST (EMNIST) dataset. The EMNIST dataset is an expansion of the original MNIST dataset, which includes not just numerical digits (0-9) but also uppercase and lowercase letters.

The project utilizes PyTorch, a popular deep learning library, to construct and train a neural network model. The training process involves feeding the neural network with labeled examples of handwritten characters, allowing the model to learn how to predict the character represented in each image.
